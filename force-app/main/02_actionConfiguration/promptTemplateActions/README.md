# PromptTemplateActions

## Overview

Learn how to **invoke Salesforce Prompt Templates** from an Agent Script agent as an **action**. This recipe demonstrates how to pass prompt inputs (like an email address) into a prompt template and return the generated response back to the user, while keeping the agent logic simple and repeatable.

## Agent Flow

    D --> E[Run generate_personalized_schedule action]
    E --> F[Prompt Template executes + returns promptResponse]
    F --> G[Output schedule to user]
```

## Key Concepts

- **Prompt Template action targets**: Use `generatePromptResponse://<PromptTemplateDeveloperName>` to execute a prompt template and return a `promptResponse` string.
- **Prompt Template inputs**: Prompt inputs are passed using the `Input:<apiName>` reference name (for example, `Input:email`).
- **Grounded data via data providers**: Prompt templates can pull grounded data via data providers (for example, an Apex data provider referenced from the template).
- **Topic-scoped execution**: Keep the “ask for missing input” + “run the action” logic inside a focused topic so the agent stays predictable.
- **Displayable outputs**: Mark the `promptResponse` output with `is_displayable: True` and `is_used_by_planner: True` so the planner can surface the generated content directly to the user without intermediate variable storage.

## How It Works

### 1. Create (or reference) a Prompt Template

This recipe includes a prompt template asset named `Generate_Personalized_Schedule` (`genAiPromptTemplates/Generate_Personalized_Schedule.genAiPromptTemplate-meta.xml`). The template:

- Accepts an `email` input (referenced as `Input:email`)
- Uses a data provider (Apex) to retrieve grounded, relevant activities for that guest
- Produces a single text response that the agent can display to the user

### 2. Define an Agent Script action that targets the template

In the agent file (`aiAuthoringBundles/PromptTemplateActions/PromptTemplateActions.agent`), the `generate_personalized_schedule` action is defined with:

- A required input named `"Input:email"` (matching the prompt template input reference name)
- An output named `promptResponse` (the standard response field returned by the prompt execution)
- A `target` pointing at the prompt template by developer name using `generatePromptResponse://Generate_Personalized_Schedule`

The `promptResponse` output is marked `is_displayable: True` and `is_used_by_planner: True`, so the planner can read and display the generated content directly — no intermediate variable storage is needed.

### 3. Ask for required input, then run the action

The `schedule_generation` topic is responsible for collecting the email address. Once the user provides it, the topic runs `generate_personalized_schedule` and outputs the personalized schedule in its response.

The topic instructions include:

- **Never ask about goals, preferences, or interests** — the prompt template retrieves that data from Salesforce via the email.
- **If the user does not provide an email address, ask for it again.**

This pattern keeps the conversation clean:

- The agent only asks for the one required input it truly needs
- The prompt template stays responsible for the “heavy lifting” (content generation and grounded context)
